# Q_Learning_for_Docking
Q_learning algorithm has been developed to move an autonomous agent from state to state and eventually dock the mobile robot

# Virtual Grid for the docking area:

Algorithm is developed in c++ with:

- 4 actions (steering and driving velocities)
- 2 states (position and orientation)
