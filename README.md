# Q_Learning_for_docking
Q_learning algorithm has been developed to move an autonomous agent from state to state and eventually dock the mobile robot

## Developed Virtual Grid for the docking area:
4 actions (steering and driving velocities)
2 states (position along Y - axis and orientation along \theta  - axis)
